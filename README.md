# Edge detection
Edge detection is a very useful function in image processing. Edge detection means detecting where the edges of an object in an image are. The algorithm looks for things like change in color, brightness etc to find the edges.
The most pioneering work in this domain was done by John Canny, and his algorithm is still the most popular. You donâ€™t need to understand how the algorithms work under the hood to use them, but if you are interested in learning more, Wikipedia has good summaries:
